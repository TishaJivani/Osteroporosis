# Osteoporosis Risk Predictor

This is a machine learning web app that helps predict the risk of osteoporosis. It looks at different health factors like age, gender, family history, and lifestyle choices. The model is built using Flask. Users can input details such as body weight, calcium and vitamin D intake, exercise habits, medical conditions, and medications. The app then gives a personalized risk prediction, helping people understand their chances of developing osteoporosis and manage their health better.
